Version 0.8.1 (31/01/2013)
==========================
* Changed the reduceCreated(int) and drainCreated() contracts to allows the
  createdTotal() to become less than the initialSize(). I.e. a call to
  reduceCreated(int) may bring the number of created objects in the pool to zero.

Version 0.8.0 (30/01/2013)
==========================
* First tagged release
