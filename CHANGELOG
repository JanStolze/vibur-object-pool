Version 17.0 (05/04/2017)
=========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 17.0.

Version 16.2 (10/02/2017)
=========================
* Javadoc improvements.
* Minor refactoring.

Version 16.1 (11/01/2017)
=========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 16.1.

Version 16.0 (09/01/2017)
=========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 16.0.

Version 15.0 (04/01/2017)
=========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 15.0.

Version 14.0 (22/12/2016)
=========================
* Minor refactoring; catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 14.0.

Version 13.0 (23/11/2016)
=========================
* Added ConcurrentStackCollection as a stack pair of MultithreadConcurrentQueueCollection.

Version 12.0 (11/11/2016)
=========================
* Added Conversant Disruptor as an optional concurrent queue/collection used by ConcurrentPool.
* Refactoring to accommodate third-party collections having interface different than java.util.Queue/Deque,
  particularly introduced the ConcurrentCollection adapter interface.
  To configure ConcurrentPool with Conversant Disruptor:
    pool = new ConcurrentPool<>(new MultithreadConcurrentQueueCollection<>(100), new ObjectFactory(), 1, 100, true);

Version 11.0 (18/09/2016)
=========================
* Minor change to the signature of getTaken() in TakenListener.

Version 10.0 (31/07/2016)
=========================
* Renamed reduceCreated() to reduceCreatedBy() and added reduceCreatedTo() method in the BasePool interface.
* JavaDoc fixes, importantly, addressed https://github.com/vibur/vibur-object-pool/issues/3.

Version 9.0 (02/05/2016)
========================
* Migrated the source code base to Java 1.7 and implemented AutoCloseable for ConcurrentLinkedPool - issue #1.
* Fixed issue #2 - call destroy() on returned objects after pool termination; the implication of this fix is
  that now when closing a proxy connection after pool termination in the JDBC connection pool, the underlying
  physical connection will be closed, too.
* Added a new parameter to the ConcurrentLinkedPool constructor in order to allow the underlying objects storing
  data structure used by the pool to be either FIFO or LIFO. Before it was always FIFO.
* Refactoring - moved ThreadedPoolReducer and Listener interfaces and their implementation classes under
  org.vibur.objectpool.util package.

Version 8.0 (02/02/2016)
========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 8.0.

Version 7.0 (10/01/2016)
========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 7.0.

Version 6.1 (05/01/2016)
========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 6.1.

Version 6.0 (19/12/2015)
==========================
* The call to PoolObjectFactory.destroy()Â is now included in a try-finally block after calling
  PoolObjectFactory.readyToTake() or PoolObjectFactory.readyToRestore().

Version 5.0 (24/08/2015)
==========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 5.0.
* Javadoc updates.

Version 4.0 (08/08/2015)
==========================
* Catching-up with Vibur DBCP version 4.0.
* Various other refactoring and javadoc updates.

Version 3.0 (03/06/2015)
==========================
* Modified the SamplingPoolReducer pool shrinking algorithm to allow the number of allocated on the
  pool objects to reach zero.
* Modified the SamplingPoolReducer logic to allow the afterReduce() method to be called even if the
  intended pool reduction is zero - useful for reporting/logging purposes.
* Migrated the project to single digit version numbers, similarly to Vibur DBCP project.

Version 2.0.0 (02/06/2014)
==========================
* Overhauled the existing in version 1.0 validating and non-validating object pools and replaced
  them with a single object pool that does not provide any special validation means, but provides
  support for a Listener interface which methods will be called upon calling the pool take and
  restore operations.
* Vibur Object Pool is now built and distributed as a valid R4 OSGi bundle.

Version 1.0.0 (02/02/2014)
==========================
* Making all vibur-dbcp dependencies having equal release version.

Version 0.8.9 (15/10/2013)
==========================
* Bug fix and refactoring.

Version 0.8.8 (25/08/2013)

* Minor refactoring and comments fixes.
* The pool reducer functionality was re-implemented in the SamplingPoolReducer class.

Version 0.8.7 (10/08/2013)
==========================
* Packages structure refactoring.

Version 0.8.6 (26/07/2013)
==========================
* Minor refactoring, dependencies versions update.

Version 0.8.5 (28/06/2013)
==========================
* Fix in ConcurrentHolderLinkedPool, aiming to prevent the possibility that an object taken from
  one pool can be returned to another.
* Changed the build artifact name to use "-" instead of "_".

Version 0.8.4 (18/02/2013)
==========================
* restore(Object, boolean valid) method introduced in the pool interfaces.
* afterReduce(int, int, Throwable) method added in PoolReducer class.
* Minor refactoring, improved javadoc, bug fix,
  lazily creates new objects if validates on restore fails.

Version 0.8.3 (06/02/2013)
==========================
* Minor refactoring, docs update.

Version 0.8.2 (05/02/2013)

* Major refactoring, have changed interface methods names,
  have added more information in the README file.

Version 0.8.1 (31/01/2013)
==========================
* Changed the reduceCreated(int) and drainCreated() contracts to allows the
  createdTotal() to become less than the initialSize(). I.e. a call to
  reduceCreated(int) may bring the number of created objects in the pool to zero.

Version 0.8.0 (30/01/2013)
==========================
* First tagged release.
