/**
 * A sampling pool reducer util, which is waken up a given number of times during
 * a predefined period of time, and checks whether the number of available
 * allocated objects in the object pool needs to be reduced.
 *
 * <p>This pool reducer will <b>not</b> bring the number of allocated on the pool
 * objects to less than the pool {@code initial} size.
 *
 * <p>This pool reducer creates one daemon service thread which will be started when
 * the reducer's {@link #start()} method is called, and will be alive until the
 * {@link #terminate()} method is called or until the calling application exits.
 *
 * <p>Note that if a RuntimeException or an Error is thrown by the overridable
 * {@link #afterReduce(int, int, Throwable)} method hook, it will terminate the
 * SamplingPoolReducer, including the reducer's background daemon thread.
