/**
 * Defines the object pool operations. These operations include the {@code take} and {@code restore} pool
 * methods. The pool may lazily create objects upon {@code take} request; not all objects need to exist
 * and be valid in the pool at all times. The {@code restore} methods do not provide any validation whether
 * the currently restored object has been taken before that from the pool or whether it is in taken state.
 * Correct usage of the {@code restore} operations is established by programming convention in the application.
 *
 * <p>The object pool implementation may support an optional fairness parameter (usually provided via the
 * pool constructor) that defines the pool behaviour with regards to waiting takers threads, as well as
 * an optional {@code Listener} interface which methods will be called when a {@code take} or
 * {@code restore} pool method executes.
