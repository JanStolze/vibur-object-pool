=== Quick Introduction ===

Vibur object pool is a _general-use concurrent Java object pool_ which provides
both non-validating and validating object pool implementations. 

==== _Non-validating_ object pool: ====

The implementation of the _non-validating_ object pool (_ConcurrentLinkedPool_)
is based on a _ConcurrentLinkedQueue_ and a _Semaphore_. This pool does *not*
implement any validation of whether the currently restored object has been taken
before that from the pool, or whether the object is currently in taken state.

The _non-validating_ object pool provides support for fairness with regards to the waiting
taker's threads. The creation of new objects and their lifecycle are controlled by a
supplied during the pool's creation time _PoolObjectFactory_.

The _non-validating_ object pool has support for shrinking (reduction) of the number of
allocated on the pool objects.

==== _Validating_ object pool: ====

The implementation of the _validating_ object pool (_ConcurrentHolderLinkedPool_)
is build on (composed) using a _non-validating ConcurrentLinkedPool_ and is utilising
a _ConcurrentHashMap_ for the validation of the restored objects. The validation checks
whether the currently restored object has been taken before that from the pool, and
whether the object is currently in taken state.

The _validating_ object pool _take_ methods are returning the pool's objects enclosed
in a thin wrapper class implementing the _Holder_ interface. The underlying object is
accessible via the interface's _getTarget()_ method.

The _validating_ object pool provides support for fairness with regards to the waiting
taker's threads in the same way as it is provided by the underlying _ConcurrentLinkedPool_.

The _validating_ object pool has support for shrinking (reduction) of the number of
allocated on the pool objects. Again, this functionality is build on the one provided
by the underlying _ConcurrentLinkedPool_.
